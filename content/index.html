## JavaScript loader

Load scripts in parallel but execute in order

{% syntax js %}
head.js("/path/to/jquery.js", "/google/analytics.js", "/js/site.js", function() {
   
   // all done
   
});
{% endsyntax %}

Head JS loads scripts in parallel *without blocking* the page. The performance will be improved even with a single minified script.

## JavaScript organizer

You've read the books and placed SCRIPT SRC tags on the bottom. Good. But can you do this?

{% syntax js %}
// use jQuery on the body of the page even though it is not included yet
head.ready(function() {
   $("#my").jquery_plugin();
});

// load jQuery on bottom of the page
head.js("/path/to/jquery.js");  
{% endsyntax %}

A typical problem in templating systems or in pages with separate header/footer files. 

## CSS modernizer

HeadJS adds classes to the HTML root element so that you can do this

{% syntax css %}
/* target CSS for browsers without box-shadow support */
.no-boxshadow .box {
   border: 2px solid #ddd;
}
{% endsyntax %}

The focus is on *CSS3 styling* and it's easy to add more tests. Minimalism is a must. It's your HEAD again. 
 

## HTML5 enabler

DIV is good but HeadJS let's you be semantic and futuristic

{% syntax html %}
<style>
   article { text-shadow:0 0 1px #ccc; }
</style>

<!-- works in IE too -->
<article>
   <header></header>
   <section></section>
   <footer></footer>
</article>
{% endsyntax %}

## Screen size detector 

Design stunning looks for __1980px__ screen and make it also work on __10"__ laptops and mobile phones. 
Screen size is the single most important thing when developing mobile sites.

{% syntax css %}
/* screen size less than 1024 pixels */
.lt-1024 #hero { background-image:(medium.jpg); }

/* fine tune for mobile phone */
.lt-640 #hero { background-image:(small.jpg); }
{% endsyntax %}

If you resize the browser window your CSS rules will dynamically follow. Head JS does it behind the scenes.
   
   
## Dynamic CSS
   
Style for various application states
   
{% syntax html %}
<script>
/* test if user is logged in by cheking out an existence of a cookie */
head.feature("logged", get_cookie("auth_token"));
</script>

<style>
/* .. and write CSS accordingly */
.logged #login-box { display: none; }
</style>
{% endsyntax %}

<p>
	Whenever you call `head.feature()` your CSS rules will follow. 
</p>	

   
## CSS router

Target CSS for specific paths and pages

{% syntax css %}
/* CSS targeted for home page only */
.root-section #index-page
   
/* make sidebar visible under /plugins  */   
.plugins-section #sidebar { display: block; }
{% endsyntax %}   
   

## Browser detector
   
All browsers and versions are detected but this is mostly for making IE behave well
   
{% syntax css %}
/* older than IE9 */
.lt-ie9 .box { padding: 10px; }

/* CSS fixes for IE6 */
.ie6 ul  { list-style: none; }
{% endsyntax %}

It's generally wiser to use feature detection but we all know IE: it's a feature in itself.
   
## JavaScript feature detection

Every feature can be found on a `headjs` global JavaScript variable.
   
{% syntax js %}
if (headjs.logged) {
   // do things
}
{% endsyntax %}

# Theory

<section id="theory">
## The problem with loading on top

A huge majority of the sites you visit today have many SCRIPT tags on the HEAD section of the page. 
Here is what you can see at apple.com:

{% syntax html %}
<head>
   <!-- copy/pasted on Saturday, November 27, 2010 -->
   <script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/lib/prototype.js"></script> 
   <script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/lib/scriptaculous.js"></script> 
   <script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/browserdetect.js"></script> 
   <script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/apple_core.js"></script> 
   <script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/search_decorator.js"></script> 
   <script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/promomanager.js"></script> 
   <script src="http://images.apple.com/home/scripts/ticker.js"></script> 
   <script src="http://images.apple.com/home/scripts/promotracker.js"></script>
</head>
{% endsyntax %}

When entering the page you'll wait for all these scripts to be loaded before the rest of the page is rendered. In programming this is called *blocking*.

The situation can get even worse. Older browsers such as Firefox 3.5 load these scripts in sequence. The next script starts loading only after the previous script is fully loaded. The first impression will be awfully slow.

A common solution to this is to move the script tags on the bottom of the page, just before the end of BODY tag.


## The problem with loading on bottom

When all scripts are included on the bottom of the page you'll end up fighting with these issues:

### 1. HTML5 and CSS3 cannot be used

The latest CSS3 features and the new HTML5 tags do not work on IE. HeadJS provides helper CSS classes to take care of these cross browser issues. But if you load Head JS on bottom of the page you'll experience a FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) effect: the page is first rendered without the helper classes and then re-rendered when the script is loaded. The same goes to screen size detection, CSS routing and Dynamic CSS. To avoid this ugly FOUC effect you need to load the script on top.

### 2. JavaScript organization get's hard

When the scripts are included on bottom you cannot do scripting that depend on these scripts *before* they are included. This is a common issue on server side template systems or with separate header/footer files where you typically work inside the middle section. You cannot execute any JavaScript that depend on the scripts that are included on the bottom. 

## The solution

The single best solution to these universal problems is to include Head JS on top of the page and load rest 
of the scripts with it. Make it the only SCRIPT SRC in your HEAD. A small job with following benefits

> 1. the page continues right after the small 2kb _head.min.js_ file is loaded
> 2. you can use the latest CSS3 techniques and provide alternate CSS for IE and other old school browsers
> 3. you can safely use HTML5 tags even with IE
> 4. you can define JavaScript code on the middle of the page that depend on the scripts on the bottom
> 5. you'll have a fast, parallel and non-blocking script loader at your disposal

In addition to that you can

* target CSS for specific screen widths, browsers and paths
* style your pages differently depending on the application state, such as whether user is logged or not

# Usage

<section id="usage">
## Script loading and execution

All script loading is done with `head.js()` 

{% syntax js %}
// the most simple case. load and execute single script without blocking. 
head.js("/path/to/file.js");

// load a script and execute a function after it has been loaded
head.js("/path/to/file.js", function() {
   
});

// load files in parallel but execute them in sequence
head.js("file1.js", "file2.js", ... "fileN.js");

// execute function after all scripts have been loaded
head.js("file1.js", "file2.js", function() {
   
});

// files are loaded in parallel and executed in order they arrive
head.js("file1.js");
head.js("file2.js");
head.js("file3.js");

// the previous can also be written as 
head.js("file1.js").js("file1.js").("file3.js");
{% endsyntax %}

## Script organization

Call a function after all scripts have been loaded 

{% syntax js %}
head.ready(function() {
   
});
{% endsyntax %}

The functions supplied this way are executed in the same order as they are given.

{% syntax js %}
// call a function after a particular file has been loaded
head.ready("file2.js", function() {
   
});
{% endsyntax %}

This makes sense if you have large script files and want to execute JavaScript before all files are loaded.
Otherwise you simply use `head.ready()` which gets executed after all files are loaded.

{% syntax js %}
// a handy shortcut for head.ready()
head(function() {
   
})
{% endsyntax %}

## Labeling scripts

By assigning labels the content developers need not to know the actual file paths.

{% syntax js %}
// call a function immediately after jQuery Tools is loaded
head.js("tools", function() {
   
   // setup Tooltips
   $(".tip").tooltip();
   
});

// load scripts by assigning a label for them
head.js(
   {jquery: "http://http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js"},
   {tools:  "http://cnd.jquerytools.org/1.2.5/tiny/jquery.tools.min"},
   {heavy:   "http://a.heavy.library/we/dont/want/to/wait/for.js"},

   // label is not required for all files	
   "http://can.be.mixed/with/unlabeled/files.js"
);
{% endsyntax %}

{% comment %}
On complex applications you can nest the calls for total loading control

{% syntax js %}
head.js("file1.js", function() {
   
   // load and execute these after file1 has been loaded
   head.js("file2.js");
   head.js("file3.js");
   
});
{% endsyntax %}
{% endcomment %}

## CSS3 feature detection

When a particular feature is supported a corresponding class name is added to the <html> element. 
When a feature is not supported the class name is prefixed with <code>no-</code>. For example:

{% syntax css %}
.borderimage .box {
   /* style for browsers that support border images */
}

.no-borderimage .box {
   /* style for browsers that does not support border images */
}
{% endsyntax %}

On everyday CSS work you assume that a feature exists and code your CSS accordingly and you later add
support for older browsers with the aid of "no-" classes.

### CSS3 property list

Natively detected CSS3 properties

- [borderimage](http://www.css3.info/preview/border-image/) define an image to be used instead of the normal border of an element
- [borderradius](http://www.css3.info/preview/border-radius/) support for rounded borders
- [boxshadow](http://www.css3.info/preview/box-shadow/) a simple shadow for a box
- [multiplebgs](http://www.css3.info/preview/multiple-backgrounds/) ability to define multiple background properties for a box
- [opacity](http://www.css3.info/preview/opacity/) transparency support
- [reflections](http://webkit.org/blog/182/css-reflections/) a reflection effect for an object
- [rgba](http://www.css3.info/preview/rgba/) allows to specify an opacity value for a color
- [textshadow](http://www.css3.info/preview/text-shadow/) a simple shadow for a text
- [transforms](rotate or skew boxes) ability to scale
- [transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/CSS_transitions) ability to animate changes to CSS properties

You can detect more with `head.feature()` call. Here we detect HTML5 video support

{% syntax js %}
head.feature("video", function() {
	var tag = document.createElement('video');
	return !!tag.canPlayType;	
});
{% endsyntax %}

[Modernizr](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/master/modernizr.js) is a good source of tests. It's preferred to append the tests inside `head.min.js` file.

## Screen size detection

Target CSS for various screen sizes. For example

{% syntax css %}
/* styling for screens with resolution less than 1024 pixels */
.lt-1024 #hero { background-image:(medium.jpg); }

/* styling for small mobile screens */
.lt-640 #hero { background-image:(small.jpg); }
{% endsyntax %}

Today most sites are optimized for **1024px** but with Head JS you can safely optimize for larger screens.
Start by designing to the largest screen and then add CSS rules for smaller ones. You can freely
decide the sizes you optimize for and the amount of them. By default Head JS watches following screen widths:

**320, 480, 640, 768, 800, 1024, 1280, 1440, 1680, 1920**

These are typical sizes for mobile phones, tablets and PC monitors. Here are sizes for Apple devices:

iPhone3: **480 x 320**

iPhone4: **960 x 640**

iPad:  **1024 x 768**

screens: **800+**

You can provide your own set of screen widths with head_conf variable:

{% syntax js %}
var head_conf = { screens: [500, 700, 900] };
{% endsyntax %}

If you resize the browser window your CSS rules will be dynamically applied. 

## Browser detection

Target CSS for a specific browser. For example

{% syntax css %}
/* CSS for IE version 7 and below */
.lt-ie8 .box { padding: 10px; }

/* CSS for IE6 only */
.ie6 ul  { list-style: none; }
{% endsyntax %}

Here are class names for various browsers independent of the version number

- `ie` Internet Explorer
- `webkit` Webkit based browsers such as Safari and Chrome
- `opera` Opera
- `mozilla` Mozilla based browsers such as Firefox

You also get a class name that is a combination of the browser vendor and version 
such as `firefox36` representing all versions Firefox 3.6.X branch.

More often than a lot you end up making hacks and tweaks specifically for Internet Explorer. You'll have "less than" helper classes for versions 3 - 10. For example:

{% syntax css %}
// tweak CSS for IE versions 5 and below
.ie-lt6 li {
   list-style-type: circle;
} 
{% endsyntax %}

It is best to avoid browser detection if you can do feature detection. 

## Page class and ID

Say you are on page: `http://mydomain.com/addons/node/router.html`. Following CSS selectors apply:

{% syntax css %}
.addons-node-section { }

#router-page { }
{% endsyntax %}

For each given path you get a CSS class representing the "folder" and an ID representing the page. 
An empty page is "#index-page" and the root folder is ".root-section"

You can change the these suffixes with head_conf variable.

{% syntax js %}
var head_conf = { section: '-area', page: ''};
{% endsyntax %}

Now the selectors are:

{% syntax css %}
.addons-node-area { }

#router { }
{% endsyntax %}


## JavaScript feature detection

Every feature can be found from th <code>headjs</code> global JavaScript variable. Here is a screenshot:

# API

<section id="api">
## Method index

### head.js(file1 ... fileN, [callback])

Immediately loads given javascript files and and executes them in the *order* they are supplied. if the last argument is a function it is called after all files are loaded and executed. Each file is either a string representing relative or absolute path of a JavaScript file. 

Alternatively each file can be given as an object taking a form: `{ label: file_path }`. The labels are a handy way to hide the actual file path from the content writers. See the `ready` method below.

### head.ready(callback)

Executes the given callback after all JavaScript files have been loaded

### head.ready(path_or_label, callback) 

Execute the callback immediately after the given file or label is loaded and executed

### head(callback), head(path_or_label, callback)

A convenience shortcut for head.ready

### head.feature(name, flag) 

Enable or disable a feature. features are stored as a class name to `<html>` element and on global `headjs` variable. if the flag arguments evaluates to `true` a feature is enabled. Call this method in your HEAD before the stylesheets are loaded.



## Configuration

HeadJS is configured with a global `head_conf` variable *before* the script is loaded. For example:

{% syntax html %}
<script>
var head_conf = { screens: [640, 1024, 1280, 1680] };
</script>

<script src="/js/head.min.js"></script>
{% endsyntax %}

List of configuration variables

- `head`	name of the global variable to be used. default: "head". Set this to "JS" and you can call `JS.ready()` for example 
- `screens` an array of screen sizes to watch for  
- `section` a suffix for CSS class representing the current "folder". default: "-section"
- `page`   	a suffix for CSS ID representing the current page. default: "-page"
