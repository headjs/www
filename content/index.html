## JavaScript loader

Load scripts in parallel but execute in order

~~~js~~~~
head.js("/path/to/jquery.js", "/google/analytics.js", "/js/site.js", function() {

   // all done

});
~~~~~~~~

Head JS loads JavaScript files like images without *blocking* the page. Your
page will be faster even with a single combined file.

## JavaScript organizer

You've read the books and placed SCRIPT SRC tags on the bottom. Good. But can
you do this?

~~~js~~~
// use jQuery on the body of the page even though it is not included yet
head.ready(function() {
   $("#my").jquery_plugin();
});

// load jQuery whenever you wish bottom of the page
head.js("/path/to/jquery.js");
~~~~~~~~~


## CSS modernizer

HeadJS adds classes to the HTML root element so that you can do this

~~~css~~~~
/* target CSS for browsers without box-shadow support */
.no-boxshadow .box {
   border: 2px solid #ddd;
}
~~~~~~~~~~

The focus is on *CSS3 styling* and it's easy to add more tests. Minimalism is
a must. It's your HEAD again.


## HTML5 enabler

DIV is good but HeadJS let's you be semantic and futuristic.

~~~~html~~~~~
<style>
   article { text-shadow:0 0 1px #ccc; }
</style>

<!-- works in IE too -->
<article>
   <header></header>
   <section></section>
   <footer></footer>
</article>
~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Screen size detector

Design pages for __1980px__ wide screen and make it also work on __10"__
laptops and mobile phones. Viewport is the most important thing when
developing for mobile clients.

~~~~css~~~~~
/* screen size less than 1024 pixels */
.lt-1024 #hero { background-image:(medium.jpg); }

/* fine tune for mobile phone */
.lt-640 #hero { background-image:(small.jpg); }
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you resize the browser window your CSS rules will dynamically follow. Head
JS does it behind the scenes.


## Dynamic CSS

Style for various application states:

~~~~html~~~~~
<script>
/*
detect whether user is logged in. here we check for an
existence of a cookie
*/
head.feature("logged", mycookielib.get_cookie("auth_token"));
</script>

<style>
/* .. and write CSS accordingly */
.logged #login-box { display: none; }
</style>
~~~~~~~~~~~


Whenever you call `head.feature()` your CSS rules will follow.


## CSS router

Target CSS for specific paths and pages

~~~~css~~~~~
/* CSS targeted for home page only */
#index-page.root-section {

}

/* make sidebar visible under /plugins  */
.plugins-section #sidebar { display: block; }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## Browser detector

All browsers are detected but we all love IE.

~~~~css~~~~~
/* older than IE9 */
.lt-ie9 .box { padding: 10px; }

/* CSS fixes for IE6 */
.ie6 ul  { list-style: none; }
~~~~~~~~~~~

It's generally wiser to use feature detection IE is a feature in itself.

## JavaScript feature detection

Every feature can also be found on the `head` (default) JavaScript variable.

~~~js~~~~~~~~
if (head.logged) {
   // do things
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

===theory===

## Head JS script loader

With Head JS your scripts load like images - completely separated from the
page rendering process. The page is ready sooner. Always. This is guaranteed
even with a single combined JavaScript file. See it yourself:

[Sample page with 5 SCRIPT SRC tags](test/script.html)

[Same scripts loaded with Head JS](test/headjs.html)

Non-blocking loading is the key to fast pages. Moreover Head JS loads scripts
in _parallel_ no matter how many of them and what the browser is. The speed
difference can be dramatic especially on the initial page load when the
scripts are not yet in cache. It's your crucial first impression.

Pages no longer "hang" and there is less or zero "flashing" between pages.
User only cares when the page is ready. Unfortunately current networking tools
don't highlight this crucial point. They focus on the overall loading of
assets instead.

Head JS can make your pages load 100% or even 400% faster. It can make the
largest impact on client side optimization.


## SCRIPT SRC

This is from Apple.com's HEAD:

~~~html~~~~
<script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/lib/prototype.js"></script>
<script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/lib/scriptaculous.js"></script>
<script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/browserdetect.js"></script>
<script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/apple_core.js"></script>
<script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/search_decorator.js"></script>
<script src="http://images.apple.com/global/scripts/promomanager.js"></script>
<script src="http://images.apple.com/home/scripts/ticker.js"></script>
<script src="http://images.apple.com/home/scripts/promotracker.js"></script>
~~~~~~~~~~

All these scripts _block_ the page. The page needs to wait for these to be
loaded until it starts rendering itself. This is how majority of web sites are
done. There is __not__ a large difference whether the script tags are placed
on top or on bottom of the page. On both cases the scripts must be loaded
first. [Compare it yourself](test/script.html).

With older generation browsers the scripts will be loaded sequentially. Here
is a screenshot from Firefox 3.0.

![sequential downloading of scripts](media/img/serial-load.gif)

It's easy to understand that this is poison for performance. The single best
optimization technique for script loading is to use a non-blocking and
paraller script loader such as Head JS.


## Combining scripts

There is a common misbelief that a single combined script performs best. Wrong:

-   latest browsers and Head JS can load scripts in parallel. loading 3 parts
    in parallel instead of as a single chunk is usually faster.

-   if an individual file is changed the whole combination changes and you
    lose the benefits of caching. It's better to combine only the stable files
    that doesn't change often.

-   many popular libraries are hosted on CDN. you should take the advantage of
    it instead of hosting yourself.

-   [iPhone 3.x](http://www.phpied.com/iphone-caching/) cannot cache files
    larger than **15kb** and in iPhone 4 the limit is **25kb**. And this is
    the size before gzipping. if you care about iPhones you should respect
    these limits.

With Head JS the file amount is not _as_ critical as it is with SCRIPT SRC
because page rendering is not blocked. Combining scripts is an important
optimization method but you can go too far with it.

## Page styling and CSS

Stylesheets needs to be
[on top](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#css_top). An
included script in the HEAD is the only place where a script is executed
before the stylesheets are loaded and where it can give a helping hand for the
CSS developer. Head JS takes this important role seriously and gives you
following possibilities:

-   use the latest CSS3 techniques and provide alternate CSS for IE and other
    old school browsers
-   safely use HTML5 tags even with IE
-   target CSS for specific screen widths, browsers and URLs
-   style your pages differently depending on the application state, such as
    whether user is logged or not.

Essentially Head JS adds CSS class names to the `<html>` element. If you
attempt to do this in a script that is loaded with Head JS you can see a
"Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC) effect: the page is first rendered without
the to-be-loaded style definitions and then re-rendered when the scripts are
executed. This is why the CSS feature detection is a core part of Head JS.

A script in HEAD blocks so it must be small. This is the essence of Head JS.
It weights only 2.5 kb when minified and gzipped. It's preferred to load the
file from a CDN. Google: I'm [staring at
You](http://code.google.com/p/google-ajax-apis/issues/detail?id=548)! (please
give it a star)

_Note: As crazy as it sounds FUBC and FOUC are not my acronyms._

===/theory===

===usage===

## Script loading and execution

All script loading is done with `head.js()`

~~~js~~~~
// the most simple case. load and execute single script without blocking.
head.js("/path/to/file.js");

// load a script and execute a function after it has been loaded
head.js("/path/to/file.js", function() {

});

// load files in parallel but execute them in sequence
head.js("file1.js", "file2.js", ... "fileN.js");

// execute function after all scripts have been loaded
head.js("file1.js", "file2.js", function() {

});

// files are loaded in parallel and executed in order they arrive
head.js("file1.js");
head.js("file2.js");
head.js("file3.js");

// the previous can also be written as
head.js("file1.js").js("file1.js").js("file3.js");
~~~~~~


### DOM Ready

With `head.js()` call your page can be ready before your scripts. You need to
prepare for that

-   The "DOM ready" event such as `$(document).ready()` is already fired when
    the scripts arrive. If the loaded scripts depend on that event make sure
    your library can handle this. jQuery 1.4+ works.

-   If your scripts modify the page you can see a "flash of unbehaviored
    content" effect (FUBC): a quick glimpse of unmodified HTML before the
    loaded scripts act on it. You can avoid this by initially hiding the
    modifiable elements before your scripts make them visible and do their
    job.

-   `document.write()` statements are not supported since it's hard or
    impossible to know where to write to. It's a bad programming habit anyway
    so it's likely that Head JS will never support this.


### Enable caching

Make sure that the files loaded with head.js can be cached. For example:

![file caching with future expiration header](media/img/expires-header.gif)

This Google Analytics script will be served from browser's cache after the
initial load. A proper max-age header configuration on the web server does the
trick. If you care about performance this is a good habit for every JavaScript
file. Not only with head.js.

Internally Head JS uses browser's cache to preload scripts before they are
executed. This trick is used on Chrome, Safari and IE. Without caching enabled
a file will be _loaded twice_ on the initial load. There are no issues on
Firefox and Opera because they execute files on the order they are
programmatically inserted on the page.


## Script organization

Call a function after all scripts have been loaded *and* the document is
scriptable:

~~~~js~~~~
head.ready(function() {

});
~~~~~~~~~

The functions supplied this way are executed in the same order as they are
given.

~~~js~~~~
// call a function after a particular file has been loaded
head.ready("file2.js", function() {

});
~~~~~~~~~

This makes sense if you have large script files and want to execute JavaScript
before all files are loaded. Otherwise you simply use `head.ready()` which
gets executed after all files are loaded.

~~~~js~~~~~
// a handy shortcut for head.ready()
head(function() {

});
~~~~~~~~~~

## Labeling scripts

By assigning labels the content developers need not to know the actual file
paths.

~~~js~~~~~
// call a function immediately after jQuery Tools is loaded
head.ready("tools", function() {

   // setup Tooltips
   $(".tip").tooltip();

});

// load scripts by assigning a label for them
head.js(
   {jquery: "http://http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js"},
   {tools: "http://cnd.jquerytools.org/1.2.5/tiny/jquery.tools.min"},
   {heavy: "http://a.heavy.library/we/dont/want/to/wait/for.js"},

   // label is optional
   "http://can.be.mixed/with/unlabeled/files.js"
);
~~~~~~~~

If label is not given then the file name without the path is used as the key.
On the jQuery library above this would be just "jquery.min.js".

{#
On complex applications you can nest the calls for total loading control.

~~~~js~~~~~~
head.js("file1.js", function() {

   // load and execute these after file1 has been loaded
   head.js("file2.js");
   head.js("file3.js");

});

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#}

## CSS3 feature detection

When a particular feature is supported a corresponding class name is added to
the `<html>` element. When a feature is not supported the class name is
prefixed with `no-`. For example:

~~~~css~~~~~
.borderimage .box {
   /* style for browsers that support border images */
}

.no-borderimage .box {
   /* style for browsers that does not support border images */
}
~~~~~~~~~~~

On everyday CSS work you assume that a feature exists and code your CSS
accordingly and you later add support for older browsers with the aid of "no-"
classes.

### CSS3 property list

Natively detected CSS3 properties

- [borderimage](http://www.css3.info/preview/border-image/) define an image to be used instead of the normal border of an element
- [borderradius](http://www.css3.info/preview/border-radius/) support for rounded borders
- [boxshadow](http://www.css3.info/preview/box-shadow/) a simple shadow for a box
- [cssreflections](http://webkit.org/blog/182/css-reflections/) a reflection effect for an object
- [csstransforms](rotate or skew boxes) ability to scale
- [csstransitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/CSS_transitions) ability to animate changes to CSS properties
- [fontface](http://code.google.com/webfonts) ability to use custom fonts
- [multiplebgs](http://www.css3.info/preview/multiple-backgrounds/) ability to define multiple background properties for a box
- [opacity](http://www.css3.info/preview/opacity/) transparency support
- [rgba](http://www.css3.info/preview/rgba/) allows to specify an opacity value for a color
- [textshadow](http://www.css3.info/preview/text-shadow/) a simple shadow for a text

You can detect more with `head.feature()` call. Here we detect HTML5 video
support.

~~~~js~~~~
head.feature("video", function() {
    var tag = document.createElement('video');
    return !!tag.canPlayType;
});
~~~~~~~~~

[Modernizr](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/master/modernizr.js)
is a good source of tests. It's preferred to append the tests inside
`head.min.js` file.


## HTML5 enabler

Head JS adds HTML5 support for all browsers:

~~~~html~~~~~
<style>
   article { text-shadow:0 0 1px #ccc; }
</style>

<!-- works in IE too -->
<article>
   <header></header>
   <section></section>
   <footer></footer>
</article>
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### List of new tags

- [abbr](http://developers.whatwg.org/text-level-semantics.html#the-abbr-element) an abbrevation
- [article](http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#the-article-element) defines external content
- [aside](http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#the-aside-element) defines some content aside from the content it is placed in
- [audio](http://developers.whatwg.org/video.html#audio) defines sound, such as music or other audio streams.

- [video](http://developers.whatwg.org/video.html#video) defines video, such as a movie clip or other video streams

IE has problems printing HTML5 elements. You can fix that by loading a
[print protector](http://www.iecss.com/print-protector/) script on your page:

~~~~js~~~~~
if (head.browser.ie)  {
   head.js("http://www.iecss.com/print-protector/javascript/iepp.1-6-2.min.js");
}
~~~~~~~~~~


## Screen size detection

Target CSS for various screen sizes. For example

~~~~css~~~~~
/* styling for screens with resolution less than 1024 pixels */
.lt-1024 #hero { background-image:(medium.jpg); }

/* styling for small mobile screens */
.lt-640 #hero { background-image:(small.jpg); }
~~~~~~~~~~~

Today most sites are optimized for **1024px** but with Head JS you can safely
optimize for larger screens. Start by designing to the largest screen and then
add CSS rules for smaller ones. You can freely decide the sizes you optimize
for and the amount of them. By default Head JS watches following screen
widths:

**320, 480, 640, 768, 800, 1024, 1280, 1440, 1680, 1920**

These are typical sizes for mobile phones, tablets and PC monitors. Here are
sizes for Apple devices:

iPhone3: **480 x 320**

iPhone4: **960 x 640**

iPad:  **1024 x 768**

screens: **800+**

You can provide your own set of screen widths with head_conf variable:

~~~js~~~
var head_conf = { screens: [500, 700, 900] };
~~~~~~~~

If you resize the browser window your CSS rules will be dynamically applied.

## Browser detection <a name="browser"></a>

Target CSS for a specific browser. For example

~~~css~~~~~
/* CSS for IE version 7 and below */
.lt-ie8 .box { padding: 10px; }

/* CSS for IE6 only */
.ie6 ul  { list-style: none; }
~~~~~~~~~~~

List of supported class names for various browsers

- `ie` Internet Explorer
- `webkit` Webkit based browsers such as Safari and Chrome
- `opera` Opera
- `mozilla` Mozilla based browsers such as Firefox

There are additional "less than" helper classes for IE.

~~~~css~~~~
// tweak CSS for IE versions 5 and below
.ie-lt6 li {
   list-style-type: circle;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~

Versions 3 - 10 are covered. It is best to avoid browser detection if you are
able to do feature detection. Sometimes it's not possible especially when it
comes to IE.

## CSS Routing <a name="routing"></a>

Say you are on a page: `http://mydomain.com/addons/node/router.html`.
Following CSS selectors apply:

~~~~css~~~~~
.addons-section { }

.addons-node-section { }

#router-page { }
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each given path you get CSS classes representing "folders" and an ID
representing the page. The deeper your URL the more classes you'll get An
empty page is "#index-page" and the site root is ".root-section". NOTE: If you
have an existing id assigned for the HTML element it will be *overwritten*. On
this case you can place the id attribute for the BODY tag.

You can change the these suffixes with head_conf variable.

~~~~js~~~~~~
var head_conf = { section: '-area', page: ''};
~~~~~~~~~~~

Now the selectors are:

~~~~~css~~~~~~
.addons-area { }

.addons-node-area { }

#router { }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## JavaScript feature detection <a name="global-var"></a>

Every feature can be found from th `head` global JavaScript variable. Here is
a screenshot:

![Head JS global JavaScript variable](media/img/global-var.gif)

===/usage===

===api===

## Method index

### head.js(file1 ... fileN, [callback])

Immediately loads given javascript files and and executes them in the *order*
they are supplied. if the last argument is a function it is called after all
files are loaded and executed. Each file is either a string representing
relative or absolute path of a JavaScript file.

Alternatively each file can be given as an object taking a form: `{ label:
file_path }`. The labels are a handy way to hide the actual file path from the
content writers. See the `ready` method below.

### head.ready(callback)

Executes the given callback after *all* JavaScript files have been loaded and
the document is scriptable (DOM is ready).

### head.ready(path_or_label, callback)

Execute the callback immediately after the given file or label is loaded and
executed

### head(callback), head(path_or_label, callback)

A convenience shortcut for head.ready

### head.ready("dom", callback)

Executes the given callback when document is ready. This is identical to
jQuery's [.ready()](http://api.jquery.com/ready/) method. "dom" is a reserved
label and cannot be used as a label for your own scripts.

### head.feature(name, flag)

Enable or disable a feature. features are stored as a class name to `<html>`
element and on global `head` variable. if the flag arguments evaluates to
`true` a feature is enabled. Call this method in your HEAD before the
stylesheets are loaded.


## Configuration

HeadJS is configured with a global `head_conf` variable *before* the script is
loaded. For example:

~~~~html~~~~
<script>
var head_conf = { screens: [640, 1024, 1280, 1680] };
</script>

<script src="/js/head.min.js"></script>
~~~~~~~~~~

List of configuration variables

-   `head`: ability to change global variable name. default: "head". Set to
    "JS" and you can `JS.ready()` for example
-   `screens`: an array of screen sizes to watch for
-   `section`: a suffix for CSS class representing the current "folder". default: "-section"
-   `page`: a suffix for CSS ID representing the current page. default: "-page"

## Version 0.9


- [head.js](https://github.com/headjs/headjs/raw/v0.9/dist/head.js) - source code
- [head.min.js](https://github.com/headjs/headjs/raw/v0.9/dist/head.min.js) - minified version
- [head.load.min.js](https://github.com/headjs/headjs/raw/v0.9/dist/head.load.min.js) - JavaScript loader only
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/headjs/headjs) - all sources

My (humble) goal is to have Head JS available on Google's CDN. This is only possible if you [give a star](http://code.google.com/p/google-ajax-apis/issues/detail?id=548).

---

### What's new in 0.9

-   The biggest and greatest feature is that `head.ready()` and `head()` calls
    now wait for the document object model (DOM) to be ready. So you can
    safely start scripting your page with those calls. No need to load an
    external library such as jQuery to support this.

-   New API call 'head.ready("dom", callback) to know when DOM is ready.

-   Detection of custom fonts with "fontface" and "no-fontface" CSS class
    names.

-   Bug fixes. Full list of commits can be found
    [here](https://github.com/headjs/headjs/commits/master)


This is the final release before the official 1.0. Please
[report](https://github.com/headjs/headjs/issues) all issues you find.

### Issues

There is no way to detect if script loading failed in IE. For that reason a
feature such as `head.error()` is impossible to implement. When a script URL
cannot be accessed Head JS is silent.

## Future

Head JS is rapidly being adopted to large number of websites all the time. A
quick [Twitter search](http://twitter.com/search?q=headjs) reveals that it's
becoming a core client side development tool for many. For the same reason I
also get a lot of feature requests. Right now the strategy is to keep Head JS
as minimalistic as it is now.

Expect *not* to see extensive CSS3 feature detection, dynamic CSS loading or
more complex JS loading developed. These can be build on _top_ of Head JS. A
separate module or extension. If you have an idea pleace consider this first.
